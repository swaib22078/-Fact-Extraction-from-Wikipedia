The proposed method (features/ data analysis):

Web scraping:  Web scraping involves the use of specialized software tools, known as web scrapers, to automatically extract data from websites. These tools can be programmed to navigate through web pages and extract specific pieces of information, such as text, images, and links. Web scrapers can also be used to extract data from multiple web pages simultaneously, making it possible to collect large volumes of data in a short amount of time.

Extraction based on weighting :The approach of weighting is based on frequencies. Every word/term is assigned a weight.Term frequency is the number of a times a word occurs within a document. We assign a probability of each term.Choosing all sentences above a certain weight threshold and Ordering the selected sentences as they appear in the original article.

Extracting the facts:Once all sentences are weighted, they are sorted in descending order of their weights. A certain threshold is set on the weight of a sentence that can be in a facts and then the sentences are filtered. The filtered sentences are put in the original order as they appear in the document.
